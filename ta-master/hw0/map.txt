1. Use objdump with the -D ag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?
	
	main, recur in .text section

2. Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the Internet if you don't know).

	.text - for instructions
	.bss  - for uninitialized global variables
	.data - for static variables

3. What direction is the stack growing in?

	stack grows downward (higher address to lower address)

4. How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?

	48 bytes

5. Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?

	heap is on the top of stack. It grows upword.

6. Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their addresses?)

	No, not contigous (difference of 12)
