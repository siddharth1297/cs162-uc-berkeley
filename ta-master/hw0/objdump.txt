1. What file format is used for this binary? And what architecture is it compiled for?

 	file format elf64-x86-64
 	architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000112:
 
2. What are some of the names of segment/sections you find?

 	Program Header
 	Dynamic Section
 	Version References
 	Sections
 	SYMBOL TABLE
 	Disassembly of section .init
 	Disassembly of section .plt
 	Disassembly of section .plt.got
 	Disassembly of section .text
 	Disassembly of section .fini
 
3. What segment/section contains main (the function) and what is the address of main? (It should be the same as what you saw in gdb)

	Disassembly of section .text
	00000000004007a6

4. Do you see the stack segment anywhere? What about the heap? Explain.

 	No, stack segment is not in the ELF as stack is created at the run time.
 	
 	As memory is allocated int the heap section at the run time, so there is no heap section in the ELF.
